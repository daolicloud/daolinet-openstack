Description: What's Ryu
        ==========
        Ryu is a component-based software defined networking framework.
        
        Ryu provides software components with well defined API that make it
        easy for developers to create new network management and control
        applications. Ryu supports various protocols for managing network
        devices, such as OpenFlow, Netconf, OF-config, etc. About OpenFlow,
        Ryu supports fully 1.0, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5 and Nicira Extensions.
